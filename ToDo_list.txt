This is list features what to do due I always forget on what to work
====================================================================
- graph validation add compatible datatypes when input and output port are polymorphic
    - ie. Add node where both input are polymorphic and output also therefore there must be some resolve how to solve what datatype should be output
    - possible solution is to put function into output port getDatatype() due C/C++ code generator is first looking for this function on output port
- python code generator
    - this would be heavily copied from C/C++ code generator when finished
- general weak typed language generator class
- list of errors click on item and focus on graph somewhere
- 2D array node
- figure methods isCluster(), isArray(), ... instead of detect these things from NAME property
    - easiest is to extend Figure object and add this methods to detect it from userData
- put getDatatype() method into InputPort, OutputPort to have it there
    - it will look into userData.datatype variable, parent node or somewhere else
- translate polymorphic datatype into right C/C++ code datatype in C/C++

In progress features
====================


Finished features
